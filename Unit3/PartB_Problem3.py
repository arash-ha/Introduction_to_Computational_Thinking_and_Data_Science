Part B: Problem 3: Implementing a Simulation With Drugs

In this problem, we consider the effects of both administering drugs to the patient and the ability of virus particle offsprings to inherit or mutate genetic traits that confer drug resistance. As the virus population reproduces, mutations will occur in the virus offspring, adding genetic diversity to the virus population. Some virus particles gain favorable mutations that confer resistance to drugs.

ResistantVirus class
In order to model this effect, we introduce a subclass of SimpleVirus called ResistantVirus. ResistantVirus maintains the state of a virus particle's drug resistances, and accounts for the inheritance of drug resistance traits to offspring. Implement the ResistantVirus class.

Hint: reproduce function child resistances
Note: If you want to use numpy arrays, you should add the following lines at the beginning of your code for the grader:
import os
os.environ["OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"
Then, do import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code.
